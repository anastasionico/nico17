						<b>Hi,<br> I am Nico Anastasio, </b>
						<br><br><br>
						<p>A London based, freelancer PHP Web Developer.</p>
						<p>I have 6+ years of projects successfully deployed in my background.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Not enough?</p>
						<br>
						<p>I have professional experiences with a global franchise of <b>Mercedes Benz</b> and an <b>award-winning</b> marketing agency with worldwide partnerships situated in the heart of London.</p>
						<br>
						<img class='' src="/img/upwork.png">
						<br><br><br>
						<b>I believe in very few fundamentals ...</b>
						<br><br>
						<p>I am an expert in the design and building of websites and web application.</p>
						<p>I use PHP on daily basis mastering several frameworks such as Laravel, CakePHP and CodeIgniter</p>
						<br>
						<p>I am among the <b>top 20%</b> of freelancers on UpWork regarding the knowledge of PHP</p>
						<br>
						<p>The main focusing of my effort is on creating whole websites and intern platforms for businesses and self-employees.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Another thing that I love is helping my clients receiving more visitors and make <b>convert them into customers.</b></p>
						<br>
						<p>How do I do that?</p>
						<br>
						<p>To do that I have learned high-level techniques of <b>S.E.O.</b> placing myself among the top 20% expert in the field in the whole UpWork platform.</p>
						<br><br><br>
						<b>How would we interact?</b>
						<br><br>
						<p>I want to be sure that I can completely fulfill your desires.</p>
						<p>That means that we will spend our initial time together studying and designing the perfect service for you.</p>
						<p>Once you are happy, the development step will begin.</p>
						<br>
						<img class='clickable' src="/img/blog/the-list-in-html.jpeg">
						<br><br><br>
						<b>As far as payment terms</b>
						<br><br>
						<p>I charge 60 Â£/hr.</p>
						<p>Usually, the payment is split into two phases.</p>
						<p>The first just after the preview is ready (I won't charge for that).</p>
						<br> 
						<p>Once you are completely happy with the end product I will start to work on it until it is ready,</p>
						<p>the second half payment will happen just before the official deployment of the service you asked for.</p>
						<p>If requested I will also take care of domain and hosting.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Simple as that.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="alert alert-info">
							If you have any question, feel fre to ask.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>Do you want more?</p>
						<br>
						<p>Have a look among the page of my website to learn more about me and when you're ready to get started, you'll just need to <b>click the "Hire me" button</b> below or at the top of the page. </p>
						<br>
						<p>Upwork will walk you through the process of setting everything up.</p>
